### What and Why?
This practical work was completed as part of my Time Series course. The goal of the project is to analyze and **model the time series behavior of Euro/USD and Gold/USD exchange rates** using several appropriate time series models like AR, ARMA, ARCH, and GARCH models. I evaluate and forecast future observations with confidence intervals and study the heteroscedasticity in financial time series data.
This Practical work implement from A to Z the PCA, doing manually the different steps to have a solid understunding of the technic.


The main topics addressed:
- Stationarity & Series differencing
- ACF & PACF (Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions)
- Auto Regression (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models
- ARIMA model
- Autocorrelation & Ljung-Box test
- Heteroskedasticity, Engleâ€™s ARCH test, & GARCH model
- Time series prediction & confidence intervals
- Scenario Simulation

- Code.R: The R code I created for my analysis and modeling, along with comments on the results obtained
