### What and Why?
This project was completed as part of my Multivariate Data Analysis course. The goal of the project is to apply PCA on different types of datasets and to analyze the results. PCA is implemented step by step "manually" to gain a deeper understanding of the process.

### The main topics addressed:
- Data visualization and summary statistics (explained variance, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, covariance matrix)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Projection of data onto principal components
- Evaluation of projection quality and inertia explained
- Visualization of individuals in new subspaces and first factorial plane

### Structure:
- Work Assignement: the detailed instructions and requirements for this lab project
- Code.R: The R code I created for my analysis and modeling, along with comments on the results obtained
